# POI Recommendation System

## Live Link https://touristp.streamlit.app/

## Overview

The **POI Recommendation System** is a sophisticated web application designed to provide personalized recommendations for Points of Interest (POIs) based on user-defined priorities. Leveraging a trained neural network model and the Groq Language Learning Model (LLM), the application not only suggests top POIs but also offers concise, engaging descriptions to enhance user experience.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations:** Users can define up to five priorities to receive tailored POI suggestions.
- **Neural Network Integration:** Utilizes a TensorFlow/Keras model for accurate POI predictions.
- **Natural Language Descriptions:** Integrates Groq LLM to generate brief descriptions of recommended POIs.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for an interactive and responsive user experience.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Ensures seamless operation with comprehensive error management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git**: For cloning the repository. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Groq API Key**: Obtain an API key from [Groq](https://groq.com/) to enable POI descriptions.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/poi-recommendation-system.git
   cd poi-recommendation-system
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - **Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   The application requires a Groq API key to fetch POI descriptions. It's recommended to use environment variables or Streamlit's secrets management for security.

   - **Using Environment Variables:**

     Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:

     ```env
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
     ```

     Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key.

   - **Using Streamlit Secrets:**

     Create a `secrets.toml` file in a `.streamlit` directory:

     ```toml
     # .streamlit/secrets.toml
     GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
     ```

6. **Prepare Model and Data Files**

   Ensure the following files are present in the project directory:

   - `poi_model.h5`: Trained TensorFlow/Keras model.
   - `label_encoder.joblib`: Label encoder for POI indices.
   - `feature_columns.npy`: Numpy array of feature columns.
   - `data.csv`: Dataset used for the model.

   If these files are not available, refer to the **Data Preparation** section below.

### Configuration

#### Groq API Key

To enable the application to fetch descriptions from Groq LLM:

1. **Obtain Your Groq API Key:**

   Sign up or log in to your Groq account and navigate to the API section to obtain your API key.

2. **Set the API Key:**

   - **Environment Variable:**

     ```bash
     export GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
     ```

   - **Streamlit Secrets:**

     Add to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

     ```toml
     GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
     ```

## Usage

With all dependencies installed and environment variables set, you can run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The application will launch in your default web browser, typically accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Using the Application

1. **Define Your Priorities:**

   - Select up to five priorities from the dropdown menus to indicate your preferences (e.g., Adventure, Scenic, Relaxing).

2. **Get Recommendations:**

   - Click on the "ðŸš€ Get Recommendations" button to generate a list of top POIs tailored to your priorities.

3. **View POI Details:**

   - The app will display the recommended POIs along with their probabilities and brief descriptions generated by Groq LLM.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python packages:

- **Streamlit**: For building the web application interface.
- **Pandas & Numpy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **TensorFlow**: For loading and utilizing the trained neural network model.
- **Joblib**: For loading the label encoder.
- **Groq**: For interacting with the Groq LLM to generate POI descriptions.

These are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be installed using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### `requirements.txt`

Ensure your `requirements.txt` includes the following (you can adjust versions as needed):

```
streamlit
pandas
numpy
tensorflow
joblib
groq
```

## Data Preparation (Optional)

If you need to train the model or prepare data:

1. **Prepare Dataset**

   Ensure your dataset `data.csv` is formatted correctly with necessary features and labels.

2. **Feature Engineering**

   Generate `feature_columns.npy` by extracting and processing feature columns used in the model.

3. **Train the Model**

   Train your TensorFlow/Keras model and save it as `poi_model.h5`.

4. **Encode Labels**

   Use `joblib` to save the label encoder as `label_encoder.joblib`.
